Description: The EXASOL R Package offers interface functionality such as
    connecting to, querying and writing into an EXASOL Database (version 5 onwards).
    It is optimised for massively parallel reading & writing from and to a multinode
    cluster. Further functionality is DBI compatibility, and use of EXASOL's InDB R
    capabilities (deploying & executing R code dynamically from an R application
    running on a client). EXASOL is an InMemory RDBMS that runs in a MPP cluster
    (shared-nothing) environment. Leading the TPC-H benchmark, it is considered
    the fastest analytical data warehouse available. A community edition can be
    downloaded for free on <https://www.exasol.com/portal>.
